[中文文档🇨🇳](README_CN.md) 

This is a Swift Server Side open source project built on the [Swift 4.1](https://swift.org) and [Vapor 3](http://vapor.codes) frameworks.

Because of apple’s release of the cool event-driven non-blocking network framework [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio), Vapor 3 introduced it at a blazing pace, leading to Vapor 2 and Vapor 3. The grammar is very different. For me personally, it looks like the difference between Swift 2 -> Swift 3 is awkward. So I used Vapor 3 to rewrite part of the interface and open it for reference and communication with interested partners.
Currently listed in the document [API](Source/API.md) has been deployed in a formal environment application, and will continue to be perfected as needed.

##### Projects are deployed at [http://api.jinxiansen.com](http://api.jinxiansen.com) (Ubuntu 16.04), most api can be debugged directly here.

Here are just a few basic API and instructions. For more information, please download the project.
